# Image Filters Tool

This project contains a set of basic image filters implemented in C++. It was built to explore the fundamentals of image processing using raw pixel data.

## 🔧 Features

- 🎨 **Grayscale Filter** – Converts images to black and white.
- 🖼️ **Merge Filter** – Combines two images by averaging their pixel values.
- 💡 **Brightness Control** – Brighten or darken an image based on user input.
- ✂️ **Edge Detection** – Highlights image edges using contrast-based logic.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++
- Bitmap image format (BMP)
- Console-based user interaction

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Understanding how images are represented in memory
- File I/O for bitmap images
- Pixel-by-pixel manipulation in C++
- Implementing basic image transformations from scratch

## 🚀 Getting Started
